## What is HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages by describing the structre of a web page. HTML consists of a series of [elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) that tell the browser how to display the content. 

## Getting Started
The first thing you are going to want to do is to choose an [editor](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp) and a web browser. The web browser can be Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Edge, or Internet Explorer (please do not choose IE). Google Chrome is reommended becuase it is the fastest and newest, but any of these will do. Next, is to choose a Text Editor. This is going to be the coding envinronment in which you are going to create the code for your website. There are many different environments, the recommendation is to read the description and see which one you like. Here are a few favorites:

 * [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)(Mac)
 * [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
 
Next you are going to want to creat a **.html** file. These files do not need a server, but it must end with the .html extension. This file runs in a web browser and serves as the root/home page of a website.
 
 ## Tag Syntax 
 <tagname> content </tagname>
 * Element names surrounded by angle brackets

# So You Want To Build A PC

Author: Ethan Maravilla (ejmmb7)

Summary: This repository is made for my 1600 Digital Systems project final. Throughout the class I was most interested in the module where we learned about computer architecture. I thought why not create a tutorial page on useful information for someone looking to build their own PC and apply the knowlede we learned about the hardware.

Target Audience: Novice level people who having an interest in building their own PC.

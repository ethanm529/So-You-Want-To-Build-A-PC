# So You Want To Build A PC
## Author: Ethan Maravilla (ejmmb7)
## Summary: This repository is made for my 1600 Digital Systems project final. Throughout the class I was most interested in the module where we learned about computer architecture. I wanted to expand on this module by taking the knowledge learned about the hardware and put it into action. How would someone know what graphics card, for example would be best for them? Expanding on that thought more, I thought why not creat a tutorial page on useful information for someone looking to build their own PC. 
## Target Audience: A lot of the times people have an interest in building their own PC but slowly drift away from the idea the more the come to relaize that the information need to build one, goes over their head. This tutorial is geared towards novice level people who having an interest in building their own PC.
